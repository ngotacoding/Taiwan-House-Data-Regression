# TAIWAN-HOUSE-DATA-REGRESSION

## Project Overview

This project predicts future house prices in Sindian District of New Taipei City in Taiwan based on historical data.
The source of the dataset is the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

## Libraries and tools used

The project uses [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for data wrangling, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html),[plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for data visualization, and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for model building and evaluation. [Warnings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) is used to filter warning messages.

## Installing libraries used

The libraries are installed using the `pip install` command.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install plotly
pip install scikit-learn
```

The specific version can be specified by adding `==<version_number>` as a suffix. Replace `<version_number>` with library version specified.
e.g., `pip install pandas==1.3.3` to specify to pip to install version 1.3.3 of pandas.
